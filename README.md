This is a image viewer completely made using SDL3 library
all the essential file needed to build the file is provide in two seperated files 
one for windows and another for linux. binaries are also given so you can download
and execute without building 
note!:
during the execution it opens file manager to select the image
if not selected the window will be terminated
finally thanks
